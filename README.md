# CGOL-PS
Conway's Game of Life in PowerShell

A limited version of Conway's Game of Life written in PowerShell that sacrifieces mere orders of magnitude in efficiency versus a proper implmentation!

Run the script specifying parameters as necessary.

While running:

Space - Pause/Unpause
C     - Clear Field
N     - Advance once generation while paused
